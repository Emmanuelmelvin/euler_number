# euler_number
This project encodes Euler number in JS without the use of Math methods 
It follows its sigma function of an infinite addition of the reciprocal of a number n, where n starts from 0 and ends in infinite.
The first approach to this is looping over numbers from 0 to an editable estimated value and pushes all into an array.

Another approach is made to find it's factotia and then it's reciprocal. 

Values of each are then pushed into another array and there all values are added up to give EULER'S NUMBER!
